In the first task, the program declares a dictionary stud_dict which contains the names as keys and the marks as values of two students. It then takes a string input from the user prompting them to enter their name. If it matches with any of the key names in the dictionary, their marks are retrieved and displayed. Else, it states to the user that student is not found.
In the second task, the program declares a list ls which contains numbers from 1 to 10. A new list ls1 is created to store the first five elements of ls by slicing. Another list ls2 is then created to store the reverse of ls1 by using [::-1], which references the reverse of a list. These are then printed and shown to the user.
